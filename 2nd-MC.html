    Tuck is the turtle in wonderpets. He has a sweet disposition and is considered the heart of the group. He normally appears in a white salior's cap, blue boots and a red cape. Tuck often makes an emotional connection with the animals the Wonder Pets rescue and comforts them while Linny and Ming-Ming enact their rescue plan. He also has a knack for seeing things from a long distance, and has a good eye.
