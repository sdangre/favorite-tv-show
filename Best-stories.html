    The best episode of the Wonder Pets is undoubtedly Save the Bengal Tiger. In it, the Wonder Pets rescue a Bengal Tiger who has a thorn in itâ€™s foot. It starts when the pets hear the phone ringing and suit up for their mission. They find out that the tiger is in trouble and needs help. They then commence their mission and save the animal.
